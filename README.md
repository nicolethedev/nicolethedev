- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicolethedev
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects, for now. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Carrier pigeon should be fine! 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Yes, I am an elder emo and MySpace introduced me to HTML. And yes, 'HTML Rulez d00d' by TDWP was my profile song for a very long time.
- 🤘 Party on.
